# Software Testing Repository

## Overview

This repository is designed to guide you through the essentials of software testing, starting with foundational concepts and gradually advancing to more sophisticated testing techniques. Whether you're a beginner looking to review the basics or an experienced tester seeking to refine your skills, this repository provides a comprehensive learning path.

## Learning Path

### 1. **Review of Basic Testing Concepts**
- **Introduction to Testing:** Understanding the purpose and importance of software testing.
- **Unit Testing:** Writing basic unit tests to validate individual components in isolation.
- **Testing Best Practices:** Naming conventions, test organization, and writing maintainable tests.

### 2. **Intermediate Testing Techniques**
- **Integration Testing:** Testing the interaction between multiple components to ensure they work together as expected.
- **Test Automation:** Introduction to automating tests using frameworks like `unittest` and `pytest`.
- **Mocking and Stubbing:** Using mocks and stubs to isolate the components being tested.

### 3. **Advanced Testing Strategies**
- **Functional Testing:** Verifying that the software behaves as expected from the user's perspective.
- **Performance Testing:** Assessing how the software performs under various conditions, including load and stress testing.
- **Security Testing:** Identifying and addressing potential security vulnerabilities in the software.

### 4. **Exploratory Testing and Test-Driven Development (TDD)**
- **Exploratory Testing:** Techniques for exploring the software to discover unexpected issues.
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** Writing tests before code to drive the development process.

### 5. **Continuous Integration and Advanced Automation**
- **Continuous Integration (CI):** Integrating tests into a CI pipeline to ensure software stability with every change.
- **Advanced Automation:** Creating end-to-end test suites and leveraging tools like Selenium for UI testing.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** The core language used for scripting and testing.
- **unittest & pytest:** Testing frameworks that support a wide range of testing needs.
- **CI/CD Tools:** Integration with CI tools like GitHub Actions or Jenkins for automated testing.
