Mutation Score Calculation:

Test Cases and Results:
T1: Mutant1 = Killed, Mutant2 = Alive, Mutant3 = Killed, Mutant4 = Killed
T2: Mutant1 = Alive,  Mutant2 = Alive, Mutant3 = Alive,  Mutant4 = Alive
T3: Mutant1 = Killed, Mutant2 = Killed, Mutant3 = Killed, Mutant4 = Killed
T4: Mutant1 = Alive,  Mutant2 = Alive, Mutant3 = Killed, Mutant4 = Alive
T5: Mutant1 = Killed, Mutant2 = Alive, Mutant3 = Killed, Mutant4 = Alive

Mutation Score Calculation Formula:
Mutation Score = (Number of Killed Mutants / Total Mutants) * 100

Individual Scores:
Mutant1: Killed 3 out of 5
Mutant2: Killed 1 out of 5
Mutant3: Killed 4 out of 5
Mutant4: Killed 2 out of 5

Mutation Scores:
Mutant1 = (3/5) * 100 = 60%
Mutant2 = (1/5) * 100 = 20%
Mutant3 = (4/5) * 100 = 80%
Mutant4 = (2/5) * 100 = 40%
